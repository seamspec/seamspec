name: supersede
description: Replace a LOCKED SeamSpec rule whose requirement genuinely changed, by proposing a replacement and asking the human to approve the swap. Use when the user says the rule "has changed", "is wrong now" or "we agreed something new".
argument-hint: <invariant_id> <reason>
---
A LOCKED SeamSpec invariant needs to change: {{args}}

1. Call `get_constraints` on the rule's scope to read it, and read its ADR if it has one
   (`seamspec://adrs/{adr_id}`). If no invariant id was given, find the rule the user means
   and confirm it with them.
2. If the new behavior isn't clear from the reason, ask the user one clarifying question first.
3. Write a test for the NEW behavior and call `propose_invariant` with every required field
   (`title`, `assertion`, `scope_paths`, `runner`, `harness_code`, `origin_text` = the user's
   words about the change). This is the replacement.
4. Run the replacement's test: `seamspec verify --proposed <new id>`.
5. Call `request_supersede(invariant_id, reason, replacement_id)`.
6. Never edit or delete the old rule's test, and don't commit code that breaks the old rule:
   the pre-commit check and CI keep enforcing it until the human approves the supersede.
7. Tell the user the change needs their approval in `seamspec review`.
   Before that, tell the user in a line or two what the test does NOT cover (cases, inputs
   or parts of the rule it leaves out), so they can judge it; say so if you see no gap.
   Offer an explanation from SeamSpec's reviewer, a separate agent that didn't write the test
   (`/seamspec:explain`), and offer to open the review for them: if your host can open a terminal the
   user types into (e.g. a tab in the Claude desktop app's terminal panel) and they say yes, open one
   running `seamspec review` in this repository. Never run it in your own shell and never type its
   answers: only the user answers. Otherwise tell them to run it. Only if this project turned on
   `[review] chat_approvals` may you offer `open_review` instead; you never answer its dialogs.
